## The rules of the game
The dice game “Bank” is a fast-paced, multiplayer game where players aim to accumulate the highest score over a series of rounds. Here’s how to play:

Setup:
* Players: The game can accommodate two or more players.
* Equipment: Two six-sided dice and a method to track scores (paper and pencil or a digital app).

Gameplay:
1. Starting the Round:
	* Players take turns rolling two dice.
	* The sum of each roll is added to a cumulative “Bank” total shared by all players.
2. Special Rules for the First Three Rolls:
	* Rolling a 7: If a player rolls a total of 7 during the first three rolls of the round, instead of ending the round, 70 points are added to the Bank total.
	* Rolling Doubles: If a player rolls doubles (both dice show the same number) during the first three rolls, the sum of the dice is added to the Bank total without any multiplication. For example, rolling double fours adds 8 points to the Bank.
3. Subsequent Rolls (After the First Three):
   	* Rolling a 7: Rolling a total of 7 ends the round immediately, and any players who haven’t banked their points forfeit the opportunity to do so for that round.
	* Rolling Doubles: Rolling doubles doubles the current Bank total. For instance, if the Bank has 50 points and a player rolls double threes, the Bank total becomes 100 points.
4. Banking Points:
   	* At any time during a round, a player can call out “Bank” to secure the current Bank total into their personal score.
	* Once a player banks their points, they sit out for the remainder of the round and cannot contribute further to the Bank total or call “Bank” again in that round.
	* Players who haven’t banked before a 7 is rolled lose the chance to add points to their personal scores for that round.
5. Ending the Round:
   	* The round concludes when a 7 is rolled or all players have banked their points.
	* A new round begins with the Bank total reset to zero.

Scoring:
* Players accumulate points over multiple rounds.
* The game typically consists of 10, 15, or 20 rounds, as agreed upon before starting.
* The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.

Additional notes:
* Strategic decisions involve choosing when to bank points to avoid losing them if a 7 is rolled.
* The first three rolls of each round have unique rules that can significantly impact the Bank total.

Enjoy playing Bank, and may the dice roll in your favor!
